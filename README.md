In a world where functional programming is taking over. There is still something magical and beautiful about the inheritance design patterns. In JavaScript that translate to the OLOO pattern to be more specific. But Some refer to it as the prototypal design pattern (Not to be confused with the clasical design pattern).

The main argument for going functional is that you do not have to think too much ahead since your code is very modular and flexible. 

There is nothing wrong with thinking ahead to a certain capacity, though. I've created this little toolkit out of pure love, this because OOP has served me well over the years. This is my goodbye to this pattern as I am adopting a more functional way of programming.
This is the best practices i've gathered from using any prototypical inheritance pattern. For beginners it is simple to pick up and learn OOP in JavaScript and for advanced users it is a lot cleaner code. Since nothing is really sacrafised I can only see gains in using this pattern for object creation and inheritance.
